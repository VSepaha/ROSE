## ROSE

#### These are the basic dependencies we’ll need:

	Linux --> Ubuntu 15.10
	Python 2.7 (apt-get -- should already have with ubuntu)
	Festival (apt-get)
	SDL & SDL2 (apt-get)
	Armadillo (apt-get)

	OpenCV 3.0 (from SOURCE - NOT from apt-get) get it from itseez on github
	OpenCV_contrib (from SOURCE - install with opencv) again from itseez
	Chilitags (from SOURCE)
	Arduino (1.6.7 or later) (from SOURCE - NOT from apt-get)
	Adafruit motorshieldv2 libraries for arduino

Everyone should install them so we can start working

I recommend running ubuntu natively and strongly suggest not using a VM, but you can if you want
